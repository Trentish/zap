# Zap Purpose
Zap is a networked web app for megagames. It's primary purpose is to display:
1. Turn clock/timer
2. News headlines

# Background
Created by Trenton Greyoak and Jed Limke. Heavily inspired by Jed's original headline tech. Due to time constraints, code quality is "average" at best and "hacky af" in some places. Some code was even written _during_ GenCon. ðŸ˜±

# TODO
- [x] Make repo public
- [ ] Write documentation & usage guide
- [ ] Clarify code standards & open source "stuff"
- [ ] Code cleanup
- [ ] Better standardization of CSS & module styling
- [ ] More/better generic modules
- [ ] Write more TODOs ðŸ˜‰ (& start using Issues)

# OLD notes, will update soon (TODO)
